# React: State and Props

Template for React exercises

## Getting Started

- Open your command line and navigate to your repos directory (if you do not have a repos folder, then you can use mkdir repos to create one)
- Use this template repository to start a new project in your repos folder: git clone <repo_name>
  cd repo_name to navigate into your new repo directory
- Make sure to run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies for the project
- Start Visual Studio Code and select 'Open Folder'. Then select repo_name to open the folder in the editor (or just type code . in your terminal inside the repo directory)
- Follow the instructions on the README.md file to complete exercises
- Open the app.js file to get started

## Exercise

- In your App.jsx

1. Create a variable `boxes` and assign it an empty array
2. Create a variable `numBoxes` and assign it the number 24
3. Write a loop that iterates from 0 to `numBoxes`, and pushes a box object to `boxes` array during each iteration
   ```
   {
       id: i,
       color: `rgb(${this.getRandomColor()}, ${this.getRandomColor()}, ${this.getRandomColor()})`
   }
   ```
4. Assign `boxes` to the `App` state
5. Create a method `handleBoxClick` that takes an HTMLChangeEvent (e) as a param, and does the following:
   - Creates a variable `newBoxes`
   - Maps through the `boxes` state
   - If the `box` id is equal to the `event target` id value, then set the box's color value to `rgb(${this.getRandomColor()}, ${this.getRandomColor()}, ${this.getRandomColor()})`
   - Sets the `boxes` state equal to `newBoxes`
6. Earlier we used a `getRandomColor` method. Create this method beneath `handleBoxClick`. It should:
   - Create a variable `rgb` that is assigned a random number between 1-255
   - Return `rgb`
   - This method is called during the creation of the boxes, and during the onclick event listener to randomize the box colors
7. Inside the `render` method, create a variable `renderBoxes` that maps through the `boxes` state, and returns a `<Box />` component for each box in the array
8. You should pass the following props to each `Box` component:
   - key = box.id
   - id = box.id
   - color = box.color
   - handleClick = this.handleBoxClick

- In your Box.jsx

1. Add an `onClick` attribute to the return div, and pass in the `props.handleClick`
2. Add an id attribute to the return div, and assign it the `props.id`
3. Add `props.color` as the span text content
4. Lastly, add a `backgroundColor` property to the inline-styling of the return div, and assign it `prop.color`

- Your finished product should display 24 squares on the DOM, all with random color values. Each square's background color should randomize when you click on it.

   - Styling
   - Table form of boxes with clickable table cells.
